# Devops Implementation:

To create a real-life heating control system that allows thousands of users to control their devices using a web application and a mobile application, a suitable infrastructure architecture needs to be designed.

*The following are some of the key considerations for our infrastructure:*

## Microservices Architecture:

The heating control system can be built using microservices architecture. Microservices can be deployed and scaled independently, which makes it easier to manage and scale the system.
We should also use load balancers to distribute the incoming requests across the multiple instances of the microservices. It ensures that the system is HIGHLY AVAILABLE and can handle the HIGH VOLUME OF REQUESTS.

## Event-Driven Approach:

I would consider using messaging queues to communicate asynchronously between microservices, this provides HIGH RESILIENCE and AGILITY.
Eventual consistensy might be a trade off though, however, if properly designed, using the event-driven approach would potentially improve SCALABITY, because it allows the system to react to event in real-time, as opposed to processing in batches.

## Containerization(Infrastructure as Code): 

The heating control system can be containerized using Docker(I already set up different envs for Dev and Prod as an example, as seen in README.md).
This allows the system to be deployed consistently across multiple environments, and it makes it easier to manage dependencies and versioning.
Kubernetes should be used to orchestrate the deployment and management of the containerized microservices. Kubernetes provides features like scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates, which make it easier to manage the system.

## Use a Cloud Platform(I would recommend Infrastructure as Code as well):

The heating control system can be hosted on a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud Platform, which provides a range of services and tools to deploy, scale and manage the infrastructure. In the past, I have built SERVERLESS applications. We can also leverage IaC(I have particularly used terraform, serverless and AWS CDK) - This allows the system to be deployed consistently across multiple environments.

## Distributed Database:

A distributed database like DynamoDB or MongoDB can be used to store the data generated by the heating control system. I used redis as a quick proof of concept, ideally, I would implement a distributed database.

## Implement an API Gateway:

We can implement an API Gateway to manage the APIs that the mobile and web applications use to interact with the heating control system. API Gateway can be used to enforce throttling, caching, and authentication and authorization.


## Monitoring and Logging:

Monitoring and logging are critical components of any architecture. I've Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring as well as DataDog, the ELK Stack can be used for logging as well.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment:

A CI/CD pipeline can be set up to automate the build, test, and deployment process. I've used GitLab CI and Github Actions for CI/CD in the past.
